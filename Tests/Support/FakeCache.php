/**
 * A small, real (not mock-library) stand-in for FreeScout's global \Cache
 * facade, backed by an in-memory array. remember() genuinely memoizes by
 * key -- calling it twice for the same key runs the callback only once --
 * so tests can observe real cache-hit behavior, not just that remember()
 * was invoked. Every call's key/ttl pair is also recorded, which is what
 * lets SplmWaitlistServiceProviderTest assert the cache TTL is 1 (a
 * regression test: Laravel 5.5's Cache::remember() TTL argument is in
 * minutes, and a prior review found this had been set 60x too long).
