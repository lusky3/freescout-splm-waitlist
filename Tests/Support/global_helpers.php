/**
 * Minimal stand-ins for the global helper functions FreeScout's real,
 * fully-booted Laravel application provides via illuminate/foundation
 * (redirect()) and the translation stack (__()). This module's test suite
 * deliberately does not pull in illuminate/foundation (see the coverage
 * report for why), so SplmWaitlistSettingsController::save() -- which
 * calls both at the very end of a successful request -- would otherwise
 * fatal with "Call to undefined function" the moment a save() test
 * reaches that line.
 *
 * These are guarded with function_exists() so they stay inert if a future
 * dependency change ever provides the real implementations.
